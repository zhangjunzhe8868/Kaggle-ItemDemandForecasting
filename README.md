Store Item Demand Forecasting

This project aims to explore the time-series data and build three models to predict the future sales.

1. How is the sales trend and growth rate over the 5 years? 
2. How is the sales trend by different stores? 
3. How is the sales trend by different items? 
4. Do you have any recommendations for the growth of the stores? 
5. Bonus: predict 3 months of sales for these 50 different items at 10 stores.
